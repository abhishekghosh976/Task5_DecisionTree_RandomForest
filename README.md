# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## 📌 Objective
Explore tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease Dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Heart Disease Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- **Target Variable:** `target` (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Split the data into training and testing sets
3. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**
4. Visualized the decision tree using `plot_tree()`
5. Controlled **overfitting** using `max_depth`
6. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**
7. Compared accuracies of Decision Tree vs Random Forest
8. Plotted **feature importances**
9. Evaluated using **cross-validation**

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Cross-Validation Score

## 📊 Sample Output

## 📁 Files Included
- `Task5_DecisionTree_RandomForest.ipynb`
- `Cleaned_Heart_Disease_Dataset.csv`
- `README.md`

## 🚀 How to Run
Upload the notebook to Google Colab and run all cells. Ensure the dataset is in the same directory or upload it manually.
